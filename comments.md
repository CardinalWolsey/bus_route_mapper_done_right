# Comments for Bus Route group:

### Tests: 19/20

  * Don't push commented-out code (remove it to get the point back)
  * well styled, well organized code

### Database resources: 14/15

  * Nicely structred models, well done
  * More commented-out code - remove to get the point back

### Deployment: 13/15

  * Live on Heroku!  :)  
  * I'm seeing a build error from Travis; get this to pass and you can get the points back

### General comments:

1. Good README

2. You have commented-out code scattered through several files. Don't push this commented out code to GitHub - that is why we have git branches, so we can keep these old versions if we end up needing them later

3. Your commit messages are generally pretty good, but could be more informative.  Generally, in a group project like this, you will all agree on a tense to use for your messages - present tense is common.  Then, make your messages informative.  For example, you have these messages (short is good, but they aren't that useful):
  * fixed merge conflicts
  * 8 tests passing

  I would write these like this (more informative, and still pretty short):
  
  * Fix merge conflicts in fileone, filetwo, and filethree
  * Write 'example' test, 8 passing

  Keeping commit messages useful is HARD, but it's worth the effort.  :)

4. HTML
  * Line 17: could be a `<main>` for increased semantics
  * Generally, each `<section>` should have a heading to be truly correct
  * Lines 50-56: put the `<footer>` and your `<script>` tags inside the body.  **Everything** always goes inside the body, so your last two closing tags will be `<body>` and `<html>`
  * Good semantics, well done  :)

5. Your JS is clear and well-styled so it's very readable - excellent.
6. Nice job taking on a challenging task!

## Overall, a very nice job, everyone!
