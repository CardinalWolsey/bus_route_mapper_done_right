This is a project for the JavaScript Full-Stack Development Accelerator at Code Fellows.

The API will take a GET request for a route number in the King County Metro Transit System's transportaion network and return a geojson object for displaying that route on a map.

* Data from [King County Metro](http://www5.kingcounty.gov/gisdataportal/)

* Stored via mongoDB
